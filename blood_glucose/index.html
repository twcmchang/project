      <a id="user-content-header-2" class="anchor" href="#header-1" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>I. Motivation</h2>

      <p> Traditional blood glucose measurement methods require drawing blood samples by trained personnel and have to prevent the potential transimission of infectious diseases. The procedure is painful, risky, and time-consuming, so here we propose a non-invasive glucose measurement method that can accomplish painless, risk-free, low-cost and frequent testing of glucose, which is an ideal method for self-monitoring of glucose.</p>
      <p> In this work, we use both photoplethysmogram (PPG) and Electrocardiogram (ECG) signals to predict blood glucose. These two kinds of signals are sampled in frequency of 1000Hz and length of 60 seconds:
      <ol class="task-list">
       <li type='1'> (4 channels) PPG signals are obtained from transmissive absorption at two-handed finger tips, including radiation (R) and infrared radiation (IR) channels.
       <li type='1'> (1 channel) ECG signal is from single lead connected to the human chest.
      </ol>
      </p> 
      <p> We collect 1752 samples from 876 individuals and measure their fasting blood glucose as our prediction targets. Total 876 individuals are split into training set (80%) and testing set (20%).
      </p>

      <h3><a id="user-content-header-3" class="anchor" href="#header-3" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>A. Signal Filtering</h3>
      <p> The PPG waveform consists of <strong>direct current (DC)</strong> and <strong>alternating current (AC)</strong> components. The AC component shows changes in the blood volume that occurs between the systolic and diastolic phases of the cardiac cycle; the fundamental frequency of the AC component depends on the heart rate and is superimposed onto the DC component. Note that the DC component changes slowly with respiration.
      </p>
      <p> To filter out the DC component in PPG signals, every PPG signal is passed through a high-pass filter with 30Hz cut-off frequency, and obtains AC-only signal. After adding AC-only PPG signls, there are total 9 signals.
      </p>
      <h3><a id="user-content-header-3" class="anchor" href="#header-3" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>B. Signal Processing</h3>
      <p> <strong>Downsampling</strong>: to reduce the dimension of model input, every signal is downsampled from 1000Hz to 200Hz or 50Hz by <a href="https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/signal.html">scipy.signal</a>. <br>
      <strong>Normalization</strong>: every signal is independently normalized by robust scaler in <a href="http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.RobustScaler.html">sklearn.preprocessing</a>.
      </p>
      <h3><a id="user-content-header-3" class="anchor" href="#header-3" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>C. Data Augmentation</h3>
      <p> Originally, a signal is recorded for 60 seconds. Here we randomly crop into five thirty-second signal segments as a kind of augmentation. We split 
      </p>
      <p> All in all, our input signals have 9 channels: 4 PPG(DC+AC), 4 PPG(AC-only) and 1 ECG signal in frequency of 200Hz or 50Hz; the length of time is 30 seconds.

      <ol class="task-list">
      <li> Developed a <strong>non-invasive</strong> blood glucose measurement method by using PPG and ECG signals instead of blood samples
      </li>
      <li> Proposed a CNN architecture to process raw PPG and ECG signals, and this <strong>CNN model achieves 91.9% of zone A</strong> (others in B)
      </li>
      <li> Utilized the flattened output of CNN as the input to XGBoost, and the <strong>combined model achieves 93.5% of zone A</strong> (others in B)
      </li>
      <li> We tried to aggregate signals in different frequencies, but the proposed <strong>multi-scale</strong> CNN model cannot outperform the above models
      </li>
      </ol>
